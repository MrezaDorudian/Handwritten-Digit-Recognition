# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
implementation of a basic Artificial Neural Network This project is the implementation of a neural network,
with 2 hidden layers (16 neuron each) and using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation to train the network.
We get 60000 labeled-training data and 10000 labeled-test data from MNIST database.
